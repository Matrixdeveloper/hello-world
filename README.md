# hello-world
This is my first Git Repo!


To the reader of this repository

  I started to learn about programming and computer 3 years ago. Although that's not long enough, 
  I have to say that's one of the best thing that I have seen in my life. The wealth and space cannot
  limit my mind!

Cheers for all!
